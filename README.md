Droidcon Italy 2014 customised IOSched
======================================

*If you want to hack some coding please coordinate with Sebastiano Poggi
(@seebrock3r on Twitter) to ensure you're not duplicating work*


Based on the awesome-sauce that is IOSched - http://code.google.com/p/iosched/
and Al Sutton's even more awesome modifications to it for the Droidcon.

Al Sutton removed dependencies to Google's services
such as Google Developer endpoints, Google+ sign-in, etc. The conference data
comes from Al's [Conference Engineer](http://conferenceengineer.com).

This fork concentrates on adapting the code base for the Droidcon Italy 2014
(see http://droidcon.it).
