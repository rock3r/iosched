The gesture is captured using the phone\u2019s accelerometer. The values of the accelerations are used for computing points coordinates in space. Interpolation is used so that the gesture made with the phone will be transformed in a continuous line in space describing (and drawing) this gesture. A pattern will be constructed based on the line that was drawn. The Hopfield Neural Network will use this pattern and learn the gesture so from now on it will be capable of identifying it. All of this also taking into account possible risks such as security issues or gesture misinterpretation.","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1385375400,"webLink":"","presenterIds":["372","371"],"endTimestamp":1385378100},{"id":"376","title":"Hardening your Android App","location":"15","description":"Android is to mobile what Windows is to desktop pc world; the biggest!
